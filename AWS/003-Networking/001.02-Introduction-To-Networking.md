# AWS Networking & VPC Study Notes

## 1. Introduction

These notes focus on AWS networking with an emphasis on Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) and the foundational concepts of computer networking. Mastering these ideas is key for designing secure architectures and ensuring reliable communication in your AWS environment.

---

## 2. Application Architecture & Networking Context

- **Architecture Focus:**  
  The network (VPC) and its many components form the communication backbone of your application. This network is the path through which internet traffic reaches your resources.

- **Role of the Network/VPC:**  
  When you launch an EC2 instance and connect over the internet, the VPC you select (default or custom) determines how data flows to and from your instance.

- **Real-World Example:**  
  Earlier in your AWS labs, launching an EC2 instance automatically selected the default VPC, enabling immediate connectivity without extra configuration.

---

## 3. Default VPC

- **Definition:**  
  AWS automatically provisions a default VPC in every Region to help users get started quickly with EC2 instances or other components that requires a network.

- **Benefits:**
  - **Ease of Use:** Automatically provided, requiring no manual setup.
  - **Quick Connectivity:** Offers instant internet access.

- **Cautions:**
  - **Security Risks:** Because resources are exposed to the internet, vulnerabilities might be higher.
  - **Limited Customization:** Default settings might not meet the needs of production-level applications or advanced security requirements.

---

## 4. Custom VPC

- **Definition:**  
  A custom VPC is a manually created and configured network. It offers granular control over how your resources communicate and how they are secured.

- **Benefits:**
  - **Enhanced Security:** Define which resources are public versus private and tailor security measures.
  - **Granular Control:** Customize routing, subnets, and security groups to fit your application’s needs.

- **When to Use:**  
  - In production environments.
  - When you need tighter control over network segmentation and security.

---

## 5. Special Consideration: Non-EC2 Compute

- **Serverless & Other AWS Services:**
  - Some services (like AWS Lambda) may not require you to explicitly manage a VPC.
  - **Important Note:**  
    Even if you’re not using EC2 instances, understanding networking is crucial because it underpins most AWS architectures.

## 6. AWS Global Infrastructure

AWS provides a robust, globally distributed networking foundation that supports AWS services:

- **Regions:**  
  Geographical areas around the world where AWS data centers are grouped. Each region is designed for fault tolerance and low latency.

- **Availability Zones (AZs):**  
  Distinct data centers within a region. These are isolated from one another to ensure high availability and resilience.

- **Edge Locations:**  
  Used by AWS services like CloudFront to cache content closer to end users, reducing latency across the globe.

This global infrastructure is the backbone of AWS networking, enabling resources in your VPC to connect reliably and securely across the globe.

## 7. Key VPC Components

Understanding the core components of a VPC is essential for architecting and securing your network:

- **Subnets:**  
  Divisions within a VPC’s IP address space.  
  - **Public Subnets:** Have a route to the Internet Gateway (IGW) and are directly accessible from the internet.
  - **Private Subnets:** Do not have a direct route to the internet; instead, they may use NAT gateways/instances for outbound access.

- **Route Tables:**  
  Define how traffic flows between subnets, VPCs, and external networks. They contain routing rules that direct packets to their destination.

- **Internet Gateway (IGW):**  
  A horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC component that allows communication between instances in your VPC and the internet.  
  - **Usage:** Attach an IGW to your VPC for public subnets.

- **NAT Gateway/Instance:**  
  Allows instances in a private subnet to access the internet for updates or outbound connections without exposing them to inbound internet traffic.

- **Security Groups:**  
  These act as stateful firewalls at the instance level, controlling inbound and outbound traffic based on a set of rules.

- **Network ACLs (Access Control Lists):**  
  Provide an additional layer of stateless security filtering at the subnet level.

- **VPN Gateway & VPC Peering:**
  - **VPN Gateway:** Connects your VPC to on-premises networks via secure VPN connections.
  - **VPC Peering:** Enables private connectivity between different VPCs, either within the same region or across regions.

- **VPC Endpoints:**  
  Allow you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services (like S3 or DynamoDB) without using an internet gateway, enhancing security.

- **Flow Logs:**  
  Capture information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC for monitoring and troubleshooting purposes.

## 8. Networking Fundamentals & IP Addressing

### 8.1. Networking Defined

Networking is about connecting computers worldwide, enabling them to exchange data. AWS demonstrates this through its global network of data centers, Availability Zones, and Regions.

### 8.2. Networking Basics: The Letter Analogy

Imagine sending a letter. To ensure its delivery you need:
- **The Letter (Message):** The data you wish to send.
- **Sender’s Address:** Where the letter originated.
- **Recipient’s Address:** Where the letter should be delivered.

Each address needs complete details:
- Name (sender/recipient)
- Street address
- City
- State or Province
- Zip/Postal Code
- Country

In the digital world, computers use similar addressing (IP addresses) to direct data packets to the correct destination through routing.

### 8.3. IP Addresses

Every computer is assigned an IP address that uniquely identifies it on the network. Unlike physical addresses, IP addresses consist of a binary sequence (0s and 1s). For instance, a 32-bit IP address in binary may look like:

```
11000000 10101000 00000001 00011110
```

### 8.4. IPv4 Notation

IPv4 addresses are typically written in decimal format (dotted notation). The 32 binary bits are divided into four 8-bit segments (octets), converted into decimal, and separated by periods. For example, the binary address above translates to:

```
192.168.1.30
```

### 8.5. CIDR Notation

CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notation compactly represents a block of IP addresses:
- **Format:** A base IP address followed by a slash (/) and a number indicating how many bits are fixed.
- **Example:**  
  `192.168.1.0/24`  
  Here, the `/24` means the first 24 bits are fixed and the remaining 8 bits can vary (providing 256 possible IP addresses).

- **Insight:**  
  A larger suffix (for example, `/28`) offers fewer IP addresses, while a smaller suffix (like `/16`) offers many more.

AWS uses CIDR notation to define the IP range of a VPC. The smallest range is `/28` (16 IP addresses), and the largest is `/16` (65,536 IP addresses).

## 9. Final Thoughts

Understanding both the high-level AWS networking concepts and the underlying IP addressing fundamentals builds a robust foundation for designing secure cloud architectures. As you continue your studies:
- Experiment with creating custom VPCs and configuring their components.
- Use tools like [CIDR.xyz](https://cidr.xyz/) to visualize and refine your CIDR ranges.
- Dive deeper into documentation and real-world case studies to reinforce best practices.

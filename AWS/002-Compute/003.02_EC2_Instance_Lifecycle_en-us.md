# Amazon EC2 Instance Lifecycle

An EC2 instance transitions through different states from the moment you create it until its termination. Understanding this lifecycle is crucial for managing your fleet of EC2 instances effectively and optimizing costs.

## Why EC2 Instances Are Valuable
- **On-Demand Provisioning**: Easily launch or terminate instances as needed.
- **Cost-Effective**: Charges apply only for running instances or instances preparing to hibernate.
- **Elasticity**: Scale instances in or out to meet demand and pay only for what you use.

## Lifecycle States

### 1. **Pending**
- The instance is preparing to enter the running state.
- AWS performs actions such as copying the AMI content to the root device and allocating networking components.
- This state typically lasts only a few seconds.
- **Billing**: Charges have not started.

### 2. **Running**
- The instance is ready to use and fully operational.
- You can connect to it via SSH or RDP.
- **Billing**: Charges begin in this state.
- Actions you can perform:
  - **Reboot**: Equivalent to rebooting an operating system. Retains public DNS name (IPv4), private and public IPv4 addresses, and any IPv6 addresses.
  - **Stop**: Enters the `stopping` phase and then the `stopped` state.
  - **Stop-Hibernate**: Saves the instance state to memory for quicker recovery.
  - **Terminate**: Permanently deletes the instance.

### 3. **Stopped**
- The instance is powered down but can be restarted.
- **Retains**:
  - Private IPv4 addresses.
  - IPv6 addresses (if applicable).
- You can modify certain attributes while in the stopped state, such as instance type and EBS volume size.
- Restarting moves it back to the `pending` state, then to the `running` state.

### 4. **Shutting Down**
- Entered when an instance is terminated.
- Transitions to the `terminated` state.

### 5. **Terminated**
- The instance is permanently deleted, and all instance stores are erased.
- **Loss**:
  - Public and private IP addresses.
  - Access to the instance.
- **Billing**: Ends when the instance enters this state.
- Once an instance is terminated, it cannot be restarted.

## Difference Between Stop and Stop-Hibernate

### **Stop**
- The instance enters the `stopping` state until it reaches the `stopped` state.
- **Billing**: AWS does not charge usage or data transfer fees, but storage for Amazon EBS volumes is still charged.
- **Memory**: Data from instance memory (RAM) is lost.
- **Attributes**: You can modify certain attributes while in the stopped state, such as instance type.

### **Stop-Hibernate**
- Amazon EC2 signals the operating system to perform hibernation (suspend-to-disk).
- **Memory**: Saves contents from instance memory (RAM) to the EBS root volume.
- **Prerequisites**: Hibernation must be turned on, and the instance must meet hibernation prerequisites.
- **Startup**: Resumes faster without needing to boot up the operating system.

## Pricing

### **On-Demand Instances**
- **Description**: Pay for compute capacity per hour or per second with no long-term commitments or upfront payments.
- **Billing**: Starts when the instance is running and stops when it is in a stopped or terminated state.
- **Recommended For**:
  - Users who prefer flexibility without upfront payments or long-term commitments.
  - Applications with short-term, spiky, or unpredictable workloads.
  - Applications being developed or tested on Amazon EC2 for the first time.
- **Flexibility**: Switch between different instance types and sizes.

### **Spot Instances**
- **Description**: Request spare Amazon EC2 computing capacity for up to 90% off the On-Demand price.
- **Recommended For**:
  - Applications with flexible start and end times.
  - Applications feasible only at very low compute prices.
  - Users with fault-tolerant or stateless workloads.
- **Pricing**: Based on the current Spot price, adjusted by AWS according to supply and demand.
- **Interruption**: Instances can be interrupted by AWS with a two-minute warning.

### **Savings Plans**
- **Description**: Flexible pricing model with low usage prices for a 1-year or 3-year term commitment.
- **Savings**: Up to 72% compared to On-Demand pricing.
- **Recommended For**:
  - Workloads with predictable and consistent usage.
  - Customers using different instance types and solutions across locations.
  - Customers making monetary commitments over a term.
- **Applicability**: Applies to both EC2 and other AWS services like AWS Lambda and AWS Fargate.

### **Reserved Instances**
- **Description**: Offers savings of up to 72% for steady-state applications with reserved capacity.
- **Payment Options**:
  - **All Upfront**: Full payment upfront for the largest discount.
  - **Partial Upfront**: Low upfront payment and discounted hourly rates.
  - **No Upfront**: No upfront payment, only discounted hourly rates.
- **Term Options**: 1-year or 3-year terms.
- **Types**:
  - **Standard Reserved Instances**: Maximum discount (up to 72%) and flexibility to change attributes such as Availability Zone, instance size, and networking type.
  - **Convertible Reserved Instances**: Discount (up to 66%) with flexibility to change instance families, operating systems, and tenancies during the term.
  - **Scheduled Reserved Instances**: Reserve capacity ahead of time for predictable recurring schedules.
- **Volume Discounts**: Automatic tiered discounts based on the total Reserved Instance spend in a region:
  - $500,000 to $4,000,000: **5%** discount.
  - $4,000,000 to $10,000,000: **10%** discount.
  - Over $10,000,000: Contact AWS for custom discounts.
- **Additional Notes**:
  - Reserved Instance Marketplace allows the purchase of third-party Reserved Instances at potentially lower prices.
  - Assigned Reserved Instances to specific Availability Zones ensure capacity reservations.

### **Dedicated Hosts**
- **Description**: Physical server dedicated for your use, with existing server-bound software licenses.
- **Billing**:
  - On-Demand (hourly).
  - Reservation for up to 70% off the On-Demand price.
- **Benefits**:
  - Reduce costs with existing licenses.
  - Meet compliance requirements.
  - Integrated with AWS License Manager for software license management.
- **Visibility**: Provides visibility into the physical cores of the server and allows you to use your own software licenses.

## Additional Information

### **Elastic IP Addresses**
- Elastic IP addresses can be associated with instances to maintain a static public IP address.

### **Instance Metadata and User Data**
- Instances can access metadata and user data to configure themselves at launch.

### **Auto Scaling**
- Auto Scaling can be used to automatically adjust the number of instances based on demand.

## 1. Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
AWS offers several built-in mechanisms to secure and manage your cloud network. Two primary layers of defense are:
- **Network ACLs**, which operate at the subnet level, and are _stateless_—requiring both inbound and outbound rules.
- **Security Groups**, which act as virtual firewalls at the instance level, and are _stateful_—automatically allowing return traffic once a connection is established.

In addition, thoughtful route table configuration helps direct traffic properly within your VPC. Together, these components allow you to build a layered and defense-in-depth architecture.

## 2. Securing Subnets with Network ACLs <a name="sec-subnets-acls"></a>
Network ACLs serve as an additional layer of security at the subnet level. They allow you to explicitly permit or deny traffic based on rules you define. However, due to their stateless nature, every inbound rule requires a corresponding outbound rule to allow return packets.

### 2.1 Default Network ACL <a name="default-nacl"></a>
When you create a VPC, AWS automatically creates a default network ACL that allows all traffic. This is ideal for initial connectivity but may not suit more stringent security requirements.

#### Inbound Rules

| Rule Number | Type        | Protocol | Port Range | Source       | Action |
|-------------|-------------|----------|------------|--------------|--------|
| 100         | All Traffic | ALL      | All        | 0.0.0.0/0    | ALLOW  |
| *Implicit*  | All Traffic | ALL      | All        | *Any*        | DENY   |

*Explanation:*  
- **Rule 100** allows any traffic to flow in, while an implicit deny (not shown) blocks any traffic not specifically allowed.

#### Outbound Rules

| Rule Number | Type        | Protocol | Port Range | Destination  | Action |
|-------------|-------------|----------|------------|--------------|--------|
| 100         | All Traffic | ALL      | All        | 0.0.0.0/0    | ALLOW  |
| *Implicit*  | All Traffic | ALL      | All        | *Any*        | DENY   |

*Explanation:*  
Just as with inbound traffic, all outbound traffic is allowed by default until you start applying tighter rules.

### 2.2 Custom Network ACL Example <a name="custom-nacl"></a>
In scenarios that demand greater control (for example, for a web application), you might choose to customize your ACL rules.

#### Inbound Rules for Custom ACL

| Rule # | Source IP         | Protocol | Port | Allow/Deny | Comments                                                                                                 |
|--------|-------------------|----------|------|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 100    | All IPv4 traffic  | TCP      | 443  | ALLOW      | Allows inbound HTTPS traffic from anywhere                                                             |
| 130    | 192.0.2.0/24      | TCP      | 3389 | ALLOW      | Allows inbound RDP traffic from a trusted IP range (e.g., your home network’s public IP addresses)        |
| *      | All IPv4 traffic  | All      | All  | DENY       | Denies all other inbound traffic not explicitly allowed (implicit and non-modifiable)                      |

#### Outbound Rules for Custom ACL

| Rule # | Destination IP    | Protocol | Port Range  | Allow/Deny | Comments                                                                                                 |
|--------|-------------------|----------|-------------|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 120    | 0.0.0.0/0         | TCP      | 1025–65535 | ALLOW      | Allows outbound responses for HTTPS (since responses come via ephemeral ports)                           |
| *      | 0.0.0.0/0         | All      | All         | DENY       | Denies all outbound traffic not explicitly allowed                                                       |

*Critical Consideration:* Since network ACLs are stateless, you must mirror your inbound rules with outbound rules for the allowed traffic. In this example, HTTPS is allowed inbound on port 443, and outbound responses are permitted over the ephemeral port range.

## 3. Securing EC2 Instances with Security Groups <a name="sec-ec2-security-groups"></a>
Security groups provide instance-level protection. They are stateful, meaning that once an inbound connection is permitted, the related outbound response is automatically allowed.

### 3.1 Default Security Group Behavior <a name="default-sg"></a>
- **Inbound Traffic:** By default, all inbound traffic is blocked.
- **Outbound Traffic:** By default, all outbound traffic is allowed.
- **Statefulness:** Response traffic is automatically permitted, simplifying overall firewall management.

### 3.2 Configuring Inbound Security Group Rules <a name="configuring-sg"></a>
For web servers and other public-facing applications, explicit inbound rules need to be created. The following table shows common rules to allow HTTP and HTTPS traffic:

#### Security Group Inbound Rules

| Type         | Protocol   | Port Range | Source      |
|--------------|------------|------------|-------------|
| HTTP (80)    | TCP (4)    | 80         | 0.0.0.0/0   |
| HTTP (80)    | TCP (6)    | 80         | ::/0       |
| HTTPS (443)  | TCP (4)    | 443        | 0.0.0.0/0   |
| HTTPS (443)  | TCP (6)    | 443        | ::/0       |

*Explanation:*  
These rules ensure that clients using either IPv4 or IPv6 can access your web servers via HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443).

### 3.3 Multi-Tier Security with Security Groups <a name="multi-tier-sg"></a>
A common architectural best practice is to segment your applications into tiers to enforce isolation and control:

- **Web Tier:**  
  - Expose only HTTP/HTTPS traffic from the internet.
  - Use the inbound rules shown above.
  
- **Application Tier:**  
  - Limit access to traffic coming only from the web tier (for instance, allowing HTTP on a specific port).
  
- **Database Tier:**  
  - Accept only specific database traffic (e.g., MySQL on TCP port 3306) from the application tier’s security group.

*Best Practice:* This layered approach helps prevent lateral movement in the event of a breach and is similar to using VLANs in on-premises environments—but with the flexibility of AWS’s software-defined networking.

## 4. Route Tables and Network Routing Best Practices <a name="route-tables"></a>
Route tables direct the traffic within your VPC. Each subnet gets associated with a route table that tells the network where to send traffic based on destination IP ranges.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Main Route Table:**  
  - Applies to subnets that are not explicitly associated with a custom route table.
  
- **Custom Route Tables:**  
  - Allow specialized routing rules (for example, routing traffic destined for the internet via an Internet Gateway or using NAT for private subnets).
  
- **Route Priority:**  
  - AWS uses the longest prefix match to decide which route to use — more specific routes (like /32) have priority over broader routes (like /24).

For further details, consult the [Configure Route Tables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Route_Tables.html) guide.

## 5. Critical Analysis and Additional Best Practices <a name="critical-analysis"></a>
From our review and additional research, consider the following:

- **Balancing ACL vs. Security Group Use:**  
  - **Network ACLs** are useful when you need a stateless, subnet-level control. They support both allow and deny rules, which can be handy for explicitly blocking known bad IP ranges.
  - **Security Groups** provide simpler, stateful control at the instance level. For many deployments, maintaining the default ACL (allowing all traffic) while using security groups for granular control is sufficient.

- **Layered Security (Defense-in-Depth):**  
  - Combining custom network ACLs with tightly scoped security groups maximizes security.  
  - Use monitoring tools like VPC Flow Logs, AWS GuardDuty, and, if needed, AWS Network Firewall to track and respond to unusual network activities.

- **Routing and Isolation Considerations:**  
  - Ensuring that your route tables are correctly configured is vital to avoid accidental exposure of private resources to the internet.
  - Using multiple Availability Zones and properly structuring your routing helps improve both security and fault tolerance.

- **Automate and Audit:**  
  - Use infrastructure-as-code tools like AWS CloudFormation or Terraform to maintain consistent and auditable security configurations.
  - Regularly audit your security group rules and network ACLs as your environment scales to ensure adherence with the least-privilege principle.

## Introduction
The **AWS Well-Architected Tool (WA Tool)** is a free, browser-based service that helps you measure workloads against the six pillars of the AWS Well-Architected Framework: *Operational Excellence, Security, Reliability, Performance Efficiency, Cost Optimization, and Sustainability*. It surfaces design gaps as **High-, Medium-, or Low-Risk Issues (HRIs)** and generates prescriptive **Improvement Plans** that integrate with project-tracking systems. Mastery of the tool is explicitly tested in the **AWS Solutions Architect – Associate (SAA-C03)** exam, appearing under Domains 2 (Design High-Performing Architectures) and 4 (Cost Optimization).

## Prerequisites
| Requirement | Why | Quick Check |
|-------------|-----|-------------|
| AWS account with IAM permissions `wellarchitected:*` | Create/read workloads, lenses, and reports | Attach AWS-managed policy `WellArchitectedConsoleFullAccess` |
| Architecture artefacts | Speed up Q&A | Diagrams, cost reports, SLO/SLA docs |
| Tagging strategy | Enables cross-workload queries | Standardize `Environment`, `Owner`, `BusinessUnit` |
| CLI v2 / CDK | For automation sections | `aws --version`, `npm i -g aws-cdk` |

---

## Core Concepts
### 1. **Workload**
A logical representation of a business or technical system. Metadata fields you must supply:  

| Field | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| **Name** | 64-char limit, unique per Region |
| **Environment** | Prod / Dev / Test |
| **Industry type** | Enables AWS benchmarks |
| **Regions used** | Impacts reliability & latency questions |
| **Prioritization tags** | Cost allocation & Ops dashboards |

### 2. **Lens**
A curated question set that overlays additional best practices (e.g., *Serverless*, *SaaS*, *IoT*, *Machine Learning*, *Financial Services*, *Foundational Technical Review*, *Custom Lenses*). Multiple lenses can be applied to one workload.

### 3. **Answer, HRI & Score**
Each pillar question is answered “Yes”, “No”, “N/A”, or “Question Skipped”, generating a pillar score (0-100). *High-Risk Issues* immediately flag gaps that may violate AWS best practice or lead to service disruption.

### 4. **Improvement Plan**
A downloadable JSON/CSV file that maps each HRI to recommended remediation steps and links to AWS docs. The file can be imported into Jira, ServiceNow, or the AWS Service Management Connector.

## Step-by-Step Setup
> The console wizard is intuitive, but the exam loves the **CLI** & **CloudFormation** routes—know them.

### 1. Create a Workload (CLI)
```bash
aws wellarchitected create-workload \
  --workload-name "eShop-Prod" \
  --environment PRODUCTION \
  --aws-regions us-east-1 us-east-2 \
  --industry-type Ecommerce \
  --review-owner "peterson@example.com" \
  --tags Owner=Peterson Environment=Prod
```

### 2. Apply a Lens
```bash
aws wellarchitected associate-lenses \
  --workload-id <id> \
  --lens-alias "serverless"
```

### 3. List Questions & Update an Answer
```bash
aws wellarchitected list-answers \
  --workload-id <id> \
  --lens-alias "wellarchitected"

aws wellarchitected update-answer \
  --workload-id <id> \
  --lens-alias "wellarchitected" \
  --question-id <qid> \
  --selected-choices "Yes" \
  --notes "S3 versioning enabled via Terraform"
```

### 4. Export the Improvement Plan
```bash
aws wellarchitected export-workload \
  --workload-id <id> \
  --milestone-number 1 \
  --output-format PDF
```

### 5. IaC with CloudFormation
```yaml
Resources:
  MyWorkload:
    Type: AWS::WellArchitected::Workload
    Properties:
      WorkloadName: eShop-Prod
      Environment: PRODUCTION
      AwsRegions:
        - us-east-1
        - us-east-2
      ReviewOwner: peterson@example.com
      Lenses:
        - wellarchitected
        - serverless
```

## Usage Examples & Automation
| Scenario | Approach | Snippet |
|----------|----------|---------|
| Weekly drift detection | Lambda cron + WA API | `ListWorkloads ➜ GetWorkload ➜ Compare older milestone` |
| Bulk answer ingest | CSV → Python boto3 | `for row in csv: update_answer()` |
| Org-wide sharing | AWS RAM + Organizations | Share WA workload read-only to audit account |
| CI/CD gate | Fail pipeline on new HRIs | Run `export-workload` & parse JSON for `risk="HIGH"` |

---

## Well-Architected Review Workflow
1. **Preparation** – Gather artefacts, invite SMEs, time-box to 2 hrs per pillar.  
2. **Interview** – Lead architect answers; scribe records evidence.  
3. **HRI Prioritization** – Focus on top 10 HRIs; tag each with owner & due date.  
4. **Remediation Sprint** – Apply fixes; aim to reduce High → Medium within 30 days.  
5. **Milestone** – Capture post-remediation state as *Milestone #2*; compare scores.  
6. **Governance** – Quarterly reviews for prod; semi-annual for dev/test.  
7. **Partner Credits** – AWS Partner can unlock up to **USD 5 000** credits after 45 HRIs are resolved.

## Lenses Catalogue
| Lens | Pillars Covered | Typical Use Case | Exam Trigger |
|------|-----------------|------------------|--------------|
| Well-Architected (Core) | All 6 | Every workload | Baseline scenario |
| Serverless | All 6 (serverless-flavored) | Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB stacks | “Choose the best Lambda auth design” |
| SaaS | All 6 + Tenant isolation | Multi-tenant products | “Noise neighbor risk?” |
| Machine Learning | Data & MLOps-driven | SageMaker pipelines | Model drift questions |
| IoT | Edge & device fleet | Greengrass, IoT Core | Connectivity/reliability focus |
| Financial Services | Regulated workloads | PCI DSS, SOX workloads | Logging & encryption emphasis |
| Custom Lens | User-defined JSON | Internal standards | Know upload/update API |

---

## Scoring & Improvement Plans
| Risk Level | Condition | Exam-Worthy Detail |
|------------|-----------|--------------------|
| **High**   | Any best-practice not met | Even one HRI can drop pillar score < 60 |
| **Medium** | Partially meets | Acceptable short term; plan remediation |
| **Low**    | Fully meets | Target state |

A workload passes internal guardrails when **no HRIs** remain and pillar scores ≥ 80. Skipped questions **do not** penalize the numeric score but may hide risks—highlighted in SAA exam trick questions.

## Best Practices & Exam Tips
1. **WA Tool ≠ Trusted Advisor**: WA Tool is free; full TA checks need Business/Enterprise Support.  
2. **Sustainability Pillar**: Six design principles (optimize for energy, avoid over-provisioning, etc.) are now testable—expect at least one question.  
3. **Multi-Region Deployments**: Reliability + Performance Efficiency pillars get weighted heavily; be ready to cite cross-Region replication vs. latency trade-offs.  
4. **Automation**: The CLI verb **`update-answer`** appears directly in the exam’s JSON-based questions. Memorize it.  
5. **Lenses Updates**: They are versioned; you must **upgrade** lenses on existing workloads after AWS releases new best practices—exam loves “upgrade required” distractors.  
6. **Risk Heatmap**: Console shows color-coded grid; expect scenario asking which HRI to tackle first (Security HRIs trump Cost).  
7. **Custom Lens**: File must be **< 500 KB JSON**; upload via `create-lens-version`, then `import-lens`.  
8. **Partner Credits**: Remember “45 HRIs remediated within 30 days → potential $5 000 AWS credit”.

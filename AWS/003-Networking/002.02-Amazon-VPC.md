# AWS VPC Deep Dive: Conceptualizing & Building Your VPC

## 1. Introduction

A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) in AWS acts like the walls around a traditional data center. It provides an isolated network in the AWS Cloud where your applications and resources reside. No traffic enters or leaves your VPC without your explicit permission. In this guide, you'll learn how to create and configure a VPC—from the initial setup to creating subnets, attaching various gateways, managing reserved IPs, designing for high availability, and even establishing dedicated connectivity with AWS Direct Connect.

## 2. Amazon VPC Overview

**Amazon VPC** is an isolated network you create in the AWS Cloud, similar to a traditional on-premises network with defined boundaries and controlled routing.

When creating an Amazon VPC, you must specify three main factors:

- **Name of the VPC:**  
  Give your VPC an identifiable name for easier management.

- **Region where the VPC will live:**  
  A VPC spans all the Availability Zones (AZs) within the chosen Region.  
  _Example:_ If you choose the Oregon Region (`us-west-2`), your VPC will span every AZ in Oregon.

- **IP Range for the VPC (CIDR Notation):**  
  This defines your network size.  
  - Each VPC requires a primary CIDR block and can have up to four secondary CIDRs (for IPv4).  
  - CIDR sizes range from `/28` (16 IP addresses) up to `/16` (65,536 IP addresses).

Using these settings, AWS provisions your network and allocates IP addresses. Once set, the VPC spans the selected Region and makes all its AZs available for creating subnets.

## 3. Building Your VPC

### 3.1. Creating the VPC

1. **Select the Correct Region:**  
   Confirm the Region (e.g., Oregon, `us-west-2`) in the upper right-hand corner of the AWS console.

2. **Open the VPC Dashboard:**  
   In the AWS Services search bar, type **VPC**.  
   Click on **Your VPCs** and then **Create VPC**.

3. **Configure Your VPC Settings:**  
   - **CIDR Block:** Define your IP range (e.g., `10.1.0.0/16`).
   - **VPC Name:** Provide an identifiable name (e.g., `app-vpc`).
   - Leave other settings as default and click **Create VPC**.

Your VPC is now provisioned as an isolated “box” that spans all AZs in your chosen Region.

## 4. Creating Subnets

After your VPC is created, you divide its IP address space into smaller segments called **subnets**. Subnets are akin to smaller networks (or VLANs in traditional environments) within your VPC. They help you:

- Organize resources
- Control network traffic
- Implement specific security and connectivity rules

### 4.1. Subnet Fundamentals

- **Purpose of Subnets:**
  - **High Availability & Traffic Optimization:**  
    Distribute resources across subnets in different Availability Zones to protect against AZ-specific failures.
  - **Connectivity Options:**  
    - **Public Subnet:** For resources that must interact with the internet (e.g., web servers).  
    - **Private Subnet:** For internal resources that should remain isolated (e.g., databases).

- **Selecting a Subnet for Resources:**  
  When launching an AWS resource (such as an EC2 instance), you select a subnet that determines the resource’s physical location (its AZ) and connectivity (public or private).

### 4.2. Creating a Subnet

Specify the following when creating a subnet:

- **VPC Association:**  
  The subnet must reside within your VPC (e.g., `app-vpc`).

- **Availability Zone (AZ):**  
  Choose an AZ (e.g., `us-west-2a`).

- **IPv4 CIDR Block for the Subnet:**  
  This must be a subset of your VPC’s CIDR block.  
  _Examples:_  
  - Public Subnet: `10.1.1.0/24`  
  - Private Subnet: `10.1.3.0/24`

**Steps to Create a Subnet:**

1. In the VPC console, click **Subnets**.
2. Click **Create Subnet**.
3. Select your VPC (e.g., `app-vpc`).
4. Enter a descriptive name (e.g., “Public Subnet 1”).
5. Choose an AZ (e.g., `us-west-2a`).
6. Enter the IPv4 CIDR block (e.g., `10.1.1.0/24`).
7. Click **Create Subnet**.
8. Repeat for additional subnets (e.g., “Private Subnet 1” with `10.1.3.0/24`).

## 5. Internet Gateway

An **Internet Gateway (IGW)** provides your VPC with internet connectivity. Think of an IGW as similar to a modem—just as a modem connects your computer to the internet, the IGW connects your VPC to the internet. Unlike a home modem, an IGW is highly available and scalable. After creation, you attach the IGW to your VPC.

**Steps to Create and Attach an Internet Gateway:**

1. In the VPC dashboard, click **Internet Gateways**.
2. Click **Create Internet Gateway**.
3. Provide a name for your IGW.
4. Click **Create Internet Gateway**.
5. In the IGW details, select **Actions** > **Attach to VPC**.
6. Choose your VPC (e.g., `app-vpc`) and click **Attach Internet Gateway**.

Only subnets with proper routing to this IGW (typically public subnets) can send/receive internet traffic.

## 6. Virtual Private Gateway for VPN Connections

A **Virtual Private Gateway (VGW)** connects your VPC to another private network. When you create and attach a VGW to your VPC, it serves as an anchor on the AWS side of the connection. On the other side, you must configure a **Customer Gateway**—a physical or software-based device representing your network. With both gateways in place, you can establish an encrypted Virtual Private Network (VPN) connection between your AWS VPC and your on-premises network (or another private network). This setup:
  
- Ensures secure, private communication.
- Supports AWS Site-to-Site VPN with two tunnels for redundancy.
- Offers options for dynamic routing (via BGP) or static routing, as detailed in the [AWS Site-to-Site VPN documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/s2svpn/how_it_works.html).

## 7. Additional VPC Components & Security

Beyond the core VPC, subnets, and gateways, several additional components enhance security and connectivity:

### 7.1. Security Groups

- **Description:**  
  Act as stateful virtual firewalls at the instance level.
- **Usage:**  
  Define rules to control inbound and outbound traffic for resources (e.g., EC2 instances).

### 7.2. Network ACLs

- **Description:**  
  Act as stateless firewalls at the subnet level.
- **Usage:**  
  Provide an additional layer of security by controlling traffic into and out of a subnet.

### 7.3. VPC Endpoints

- **Description:**  
  Enable private connections between your VPC and supported AWS services (e.g., Amazon S3, DynamoDB) without requiring an IGW, NAT, VPN, or Direct Connect.
- **Types:**  
  - **Interface Endpoints:** Powered by AWS PrivateLink.  
  - **Gateway Endpoints:** Primarily used for S3 and DynamoDB.

### 7.4. Flow Logs

- **Description:**  
  Capture information about IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC.
- **Usage:**  
  Useful for monitoring, troubleshooting, and security analysis.

## 8. Reserved IPs in AWS Subnets

AWS reserves five IP addresses in each subnet for essential functions such as routing, DNS, and network management. These addresses are not available for assignment to your resources, so you must account for them when designing your CIDR blocks.

### 8.1. Impact on Subnet Design

- **Example:**  
  A VPC with IP range `10.0.0.0/22` provides 1,024 addresses. Dividing this into four `/24` subnets gives 256 addresses per subnet. With five reserved per subnet, 251 IP addresses remain usable.

### 8.2. Reserved IPs Overview

A conceptual breakdown for a `/24` subnet:

- **Reserved:** 5 IP addresses (for network address, VPC router, DNS server, future use, and broadcast).
- **Usable:** 251 IP addresses.

| **Reserved IP Purpose**     | **Example Address (in a subnet)** |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Network address             | e.g., 10.0.0.0                    |
| VPC local router            | e.g., 10.0.0.1                    |
| DNS server                  | e.g., 10.0.0.2                    |
| Future use                  | e.g., 10.0.0.3                    |
| Broadcast address           | e.g., 10.0.0.255                  |

### 8.3. Best Practices

- **Subnet Sizing:**  
  Commonly, a VPC is designed with a `/16` range and segmented into `/24` subnets, ensuring ample IP addresses even after subtracting the five reserved addresses.
- **Planning:**  
  Verify that your CIDR allocations meet your workload needs.

## 9. AWS Direct Connect

**AWS Direct Connect** lets you establish a secure, dedicated physical connection between your on-premises data center and your Amazon VPC. Using a standard Ethernet fiber-optic cable to connect to an AWS Direct Connect location, you can:

- Create virtual interfaces that connect directly to your VPC or public AWS services.
- Benefit from improved performance, lower latency, and enhanced security by bypassing the public internet.
- Leverage both private and public virtual interfaces to meet varied networking requirements.

## 10. Practical Example Recap: Employee Directory App

For the Employee Directory application, the demonstrated setup included:

1. **VPC Creation:**  
   - **Region:** Oregon (`us-west-2`)
   - **CIDR Block:** `10.1.0.0/16`
   - **VPC Name:** `app-vpc`

2. **Subnets (in AZ A - `us-west-2a`):**
   - **Public Subnet 1:**  
     - **CIDR:** `10.1.1.0/24` (for internet-facing resources)
   - **Private Subnet 1:**  
     - **CIDR:** `10.1.3.0/24` (for internal resources)

3. **Internet Gateway Attachment:**  
   - An IGW was created and attached to `app-vpc` to allow internet connectivity for public subnets.

4. **High Availability:**  
   - Additional subnets were planned in a second Availability Zone (`us-west-2b`) to ensure redundancy and fault tolerance.

5. **EC2 Instance Launch:**  
   - Later demonstrations included launching an EC2 instance in a public subnet and replicating resources across multiple AZs.

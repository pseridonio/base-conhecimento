# AWS Compute as a Service

## Overview
At a fundamental level, AWS offers three types of compute options:
- **Virtual Machines (VMs)**
- **Container Services**
- **Serverless Compute**

## The Need for Compute
Every business requires compute capacity to run applications. These applications might include:
- Web servers
- Batch jobs
- Databases
- HR software
- Machine learning

Traditionally, the time, money, and effort required to set up on-premises computing resources are significant.

## Servers: The Building Block of Applications
The first building block to host an application is a **server**:
- Servers handle HTTP requests and send responses following the client-server model.
- API-based communication also falls under this model.

### Client-Server Model
- **Client**: A person or computer that sends a request.
- **Server**: A computer, or collection of computers, connected to the internet serving websites and applications to users.

### Server Capabilities
Servers provide:
- **CPU**: Compute power for processing.
- **Memory**: Data storage for applications and requests.
- **Networking**: Capacity to handle communication with users.

### Examples of HTTP Servers
- **Windows Options**: Internet Information Services (IIS)
- **Linux Options**: Apache HTTP Server, Nginx, Apache Tomcat

To run an HTTP server on AWS, you need to choose a compute service in the AWS Management Console, where all available AWS compute services are listed.

## Challenges of On-Premises Infrastructure
Owning physical servers involves:
1. **Research & Purchase**: Determine what type and how many servers to buy.
2. **Delivery Wait Times**: Servers often take weeks or months to arrive.
3. **Installation**: Servers must be installed, racked, stacked, and wired at a data center.
4. **Setup & Maintenance**: Servers require securing, powering, and ongoing upkeep.
5. **Rigid Investment**: Once purchased, you're stuck with the servers, whether used or not.

Scaling physical infrastructure quickly is challenging, and recovering unused investments is nearly impossible.

## Advantages of Compute as a Service
AWS simplifies operations by handling:
- Data center setup and security.
- Hardware procurement, installation, and maintenance.

AWS offers compute capacity that is readily available online, enabling businesses to focus on their applications instead of infrastructure.

### Benefits of AWS Compute
1. **Right Compute for Your Workloads**: Tailored solutions for diverse workloads ensure optimal performance and cost-efficiency.
2. **Security Built-In**: Robust security features include the AWS Nitro System and compliance with standards like PCI-DSS, HIPAA, and GDPR.
3. **Flexibility to Optimize Costs**: Pricing models like EC2 Spot Instances and Savings Plans offer significant cost savings.
4. **Compute Where You Need It**: AWS extends to edge locations and on-premises environments with services like AWS Outposts and AWS Local Zones.

## Key Compute Services on AWS

### Amazon EC2: Virtual Machines
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure and resizable compute capacity in the cloud. With EC2, you can provision virtual servers called **EC2 instances**. Behind the scenes:
- AWS manages the host machines and hypervisor layer.
- AWS installs the virtual machine operating system, called the **guest operating system**.

### Other Compute Options
Apart from virtual machines like EC2, AWS provides:
1. **Container Services**: Ideal for managing containerized applications.
2. **Serverless Compute**: Perfect for building applications optimized for scalability and efficiency.

### The AWS Nitro System
AWS reimagined virtualization infrastructure with the AWS Nitro System, which includes:
- **Nitro Cards**: Offload and accelerate I/O functions for improved performance.
- **Nitro Security Chip**: Enhances security by offloading critical functions to dedicated hardware and prohibiting administrative access.
- **Nitro Hypervisor**: A lightweight hypervisor that manages memory and CPU allocation, delivering near bare-metal performance.

### Choosing the Right Compute Option
When setting up servers on AWS, you must choose the right compute service for your use case. At a fundamental level, three types of compute options are available:
1. **Virtual Machines (VMs)**:
   - Emulates a physical server and allows the installation of an HTTP server.
   - Requires a **hypervisor** (software or firmware) to manage physical hardware resources across virtual machines.
2. **Container Services**:
   - Suitable for containerized applications.
3. **Serverless Compute**:
   - Ideal for scalable, event-driven applications.

Some AWS compute services, like container services and serverless options, are built on EC2 or virtualization concepts. Understanding Amazon EC2 is a foundational step before progressing to these advanced options.

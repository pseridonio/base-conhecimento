# Design Patterns: Critical Reference Guide

## Core Pattern Categories
### 1. Creational Patterns
**Patterns that encapsulate object creation mechanisms, promoting flexibility and reuse. Solve object creation complexities.**  
- `Abstract Factory`
- `Builder`
- `Factory Method`
- `Prototype`  
- `Singleton`

| Language | Critical Nuance | AI Prompt |
|----------|-----------------|-----------|
| C# | Use `Lazy<T>` for thread-safety | *"Show safe Singleton impl in C# with Lazy<T>"* |
| Java | Prefer enum singletons | *"Explain Joshua Bloch's enum Singleton approach"* |
| Python | Modules > Singleton | *"Why is Singleton anti-pattern in Python?"* |

### 2. Structural Patterns
**Patterns that deal with object composition and relationships, simplifying how parts fit together. Manage object composition.**  
- `Adapter`
- `Bridge`
- `Composite`
- `Decorator`
- `Facade`
- `Flyweight`  
- `Proxy`

| Pattern | Risk | AI Directive |
|---------|------|--------------|
| Decorator | Wrapper hell | *"Detect excessive decorator chaining in [code]"* |
| Flyweight | Memory/CPU tradeoff | *"Calculate memory savings for Flyweight in [scenario]"* |
| Adapter | Unnecessary abstraction | *"Suggest when to refactor Adapter vs rewrite interfaces"* |

### 3. Behavioral Patterns
**Patterns that define how objects interact and distribute responsibility. Streamline communication.**  
- `Chain of Responsibility`
- `Command`
- `Interpreter`
- `Iterator`
- `Mediator`
- `Memento`
- `Observer`
- `State`
- `Strategy`
- `Template Method`
- `Visitor`  

| Language | Modern Alternative | AI Prompt |
|----------|--------------------|-----------|
| C#/Java | RxJava/ReactiveX > Observer | *"Convert Observer to Reactive Streams in [language]"* |
| Python | Generators > Iterator | *"Replace Iterator with Python generator for [use case]"* |

### 4. Concurrency Patterns  
**Patterns that help manage multi‚Äëthreaded or asynchronous execution.**  
- `Active Object`  
- `Guarded Suspension`  
- `Monitor Object`  
- `Read‚ÄìWrite Lock`  
- `Scheduler`  
- `Thread‚ÄëSafe Wrapper`  
- `Thread Pool`  

### 5. Architectural & Enterprise Patterns  
**High‚Äëlevel patterns that govern system structure and enterprise concerns.**  
- `Broker`  
- `Dependency Injection`  
- `Event‚ÄëDriven Architecture`  
- `Layered (n‚ÄëTier) Architecture`  
- `Model‚ÄìView‚ÄìController (MVC)`
- `Microkernel (Plug‚Äëin) Architecture`  
- `Microservices Architecture`  
- `Model‚ÄìView‚ÄìPresenter (MVP)`  
- `Model‚ÄìView‚ÄìViewModel (MVVM)`  
- `Service Locator`  

### 6. Controversial Omissions & Additions
1. Concurrency Patterns (Producer-Consumer, Thread Pool) are sometimes categorized separately but are not in GoF's original taxonomy.

2. Architectural Patterns (MVC, MVVM) are beyond classic GoF scope (higher abstraction level).

3. Critique of GoF Completeness:
    - Modern languages render some patterns obsolete (e.g., Interpreter is rarely needed in Python/Java due to built-in parsing libs).
    - New patterns like Dependency Injection (often misclassified as Creational) are now fundamental in .NET/Java ecosystems.

### Importance

1. **Standardized Vocabulary**  
   - Patterns give developers a common language (e.g. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs use a Factory Method here‚Äù) that speeds communication across teams and code reviews.  

2. **Proven Solutions**  
   - Rather than inventing a custom approach, you leverage time‚Äëtested recipes that address pitfalls and edge cases.  
   - 30+ years validated solutions for recurring problems  
   - *AI Prompt:* "Explain how [Pattern] solves [specific problem] in [context]"  

3. **Bridging Theory & Practice**  
   - Patterns distill best practices from object‚Äëoriented design, making abstract principles (like SOLID) concrete and actionable.  

4. **Architecture Guidance**  
   - At a higher level, patterns help you structure subsystems, manage dependencies, and define clear module boundaries.

### Benefits

| Benefit                       | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Maintainability**           | Consistent structures are easier to understand and evolve over time.         |
| **Reusability**               | Encapsulated patterns can be applied across projects, reducing duplication.  |
| **Flexibility & Extensibility** | Many patterns (e.g. Strategy, Observer) allow behavior to vary at runtime.    |
| **Decoupling**                | Patterns like Adapter or Facade isolate changes, preventing ripple effects.  |
| **Testability**               | Well‚Äëstructured code (e.g. through Dependency Injection) is simpler to mock and isolate in tests. |
| **Onboarding & Knowledge Transfer** | New team members recognize familiar patterns and ramp up more quickly.       |



## Critical Risks & Limitations
‚ö†Ô∏è **Over-Engineering**  
- Pattern misapplication violates YAGNI/KISS  
- *AI Red Flag:* "Detect pattern overkill in [code snippet]"  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Language Irrelevance**  
| Pattern | Obsolete When | Better Alternative |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| Iterator | Python | Generators (`yield`) |
| Factory | Java 8+ | `Supplier<T>` |
| Builder | Python/C# | Named parameters |

‚ö†Ô∏è **Performance Costs**  
| Pattern | Overhead | Mitigation |
|---------|----------|------------|
| Decorator | Call stack depth | Limit chain length |
| Flyweight | Pool management | Profile before use |
| Proxy | Network latency | Cache locally |

using [language2] idioms. 
Highlight:
- Line reduction % 
- Readability changes 
- Potential tradeoffs"

## Critical Principles for AI
1. **First Question**  
   "What _specific problem_ are you solving?"  

2. **Validation Checklist**  
   - [ ] Language-native alternative exists?  
   - [ ] Team understands pattern tradeoffs?  
   - [ ] Meets scalability requirements?  

3. **Red Flags**  
   - User says "I need to make this more enterprise-y"  
   - Pattern forces inheritance over composition  
   - >3 abstraction layers for simple logic  

4. **Fallback Rule**  
   "When uncertain, recommend:  
   ```python
   # Pythonic alternative
   from typing import Protocol
   class PaymentMethod(Protocol):
       def pay(self, amount: float) -> None: ...
   ```"
```

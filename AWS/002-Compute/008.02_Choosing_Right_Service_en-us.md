# Which AWS Compute Service Should I Choose For My Use Case?  

*The AWS Compute Service Game Show*

At this point, you've explored several AWS compute services, and each one can handle a variety of use cases. But how do you know which one is the right fit for your workload? Welcome to our game show where you—the contestant—will choose the correct AWS compute service for different scenarios. Ready? Let’s play!

## Overview of the Game

We’ll present three real-world use cases. For each, you have five seconds to decide which AWS compute service is best suited for the job. After each question, we'll explain the answer and discuss the thought process behind eliminating the other options.

## Use Case 1: Automating Inventory Updates

**Scenario:**  
Imagine you’re developing a new feature for an online store hosted on EC2. Currently, every new item in the store is added manually to a database—a time-consuming and error-prone process. Your task is to automate this process. The proposed solution: allow a user to upload an inventory spreadsheet to Amazon S3, which then triggers an automated process to update the inventory database.

**Question:**  
What compute service would you use to host the processing logic that reads the spreadsheet and updates the database?  
*(You have five seconds on the clock.)*

**Time’s Up!**

**Discussion & Answer:**  
- **Option 1: Amazon EC2**  
  You could use EC2 by spinning up an instance to poll the S3 bucket for new files. However, if inventory updates occur only once a quarter, keeping an always-on instance running is cost-inefficient.
  
- **Final Answer: AWS Lambda**  
  AWS Lambda is ideal because it only runs when triggered—here, by an S3 PUT event. It’s extremely cost effective, since you pay only for the compute time used when a new inventory document is uploaded.

**How It Works:**  
1. Create a Lambda function that parses the spreadsheet and updates the database.  
2. Configure Amazon S3 to trigger the Lambda function on a file upload (via a PUT event).  
3. When the spreadsheet is uploaded, the function processes the file and updates the inventory—all without an always-on server.

## Use Case 2: Migrating a Legacy Application

**Scenario:**  
You have an application currently hosted on your on-premises Linux servers that needs to be migrated to AWS. The goal is to minimize refactoring during migration while ensuring the solution can scale elastically with demand.

**Question:**  
Which compute option should you choose?  
*(Five seconds on the clock.)*

**Time’s Up!**

**Discussion & Answer:**  
- **Option 1: AWS Lambda**  
  Although Lambda offers great scalability and cost savings, moving an entire application with minimal changes into Lambda would require significant refactoring.
  
- **Final Answer: Amazon EC2**  
  Amazon EC2 is best here. By launching instances from Linux-based AMIs, you can migrate the on-premises application with little modification while taking advantage of auto scaling to adjust to varying demands.

**Additional Insight:**  
Using EC2 allows you to replicate an on-premises environment in the cloud. There's minimal refactoring required, and the scaling capabilities of EC2 (or even an Auto Scaling Group) ensure that your application can handle changes in load as needed.

## Use Case 3: Building a New Microservices Application

**Scenario:**  
For this scenario, you’re developing a brand-new application from the ground up using a microservices or service-oriented architecture. You need a solution that can quickly scale, minimizes risk when deploying updates, and ensures that code behaves consistently across development, testing, and production environments.

**Question:**  
Which AWS compute service would be the best choice?  
*(Five seconds on the clock.)*

**Time’s Up!**

**Discussion & Answer:**  
- **Option 1: Amazon EC2**  
  While EC2 can be used, maintaining and scaling individual microservices manually isn’t as efficient for rapid iterations.
  
- **Option 2: AWS Lambda**  
  Lambda is great for event-driven, lightweight functions, but transforming a full microservices architecture to run on Lambda can require a shift in design and additional refactoring.
  
- **Final Answer: AWS Container Services (Amazon ECS or Amazon EKS)**  
  Container services like ECS or EKS are ideal for microservices. Containers launch quickly, offer excellent scalability, and provide portability, ensuring that your code runs consistently across environments. This minimizes deployment risk and enhances the agility of your development process.

**Why Containers?**  
- **Rapid Scaling:** Containers start in a matter of seconds, making scaling nearly instantaneous.  
- **Portability:** Code developed in a container behaves the same in development, testing, and production, reducing deployment errors.  
- **Microservices Support:** Containers naturally support a microservices architecture by isolating workloads, facilitating independent scaling and development.

## Final Thoughts

Choosing the right AWS compute service is all about matching the characteristics of your workload with the strengths of the service:
- **Use AWS Lambda** for event-driven, infrequent, or cost-sensitive tasks that run quickly.
- **Choose Amazon EC2** when you need full control of the underlying infrastructure or when minimal refactoring is desired.
- **Opt for AWS Container Services (ECS/EKS)** when building modern, scalable microservices architectures that benefit from containerization.

Remember, there’s no one-size-fits-all solution. AWS provides a variety of compute options precisely so you can choose the right tool for the job. As AWS continues to evolve its services, it’s wise to periodically reevaluate and, if necessary, update your technology choices.

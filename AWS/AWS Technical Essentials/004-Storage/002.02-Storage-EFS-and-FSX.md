## Amazon Elastic File System (EFS)

### Strengths

* **Seamless scaling**
  Automatically grows and shrinks as you add or remove files—no capacity planning or provisioning needed.
* **High durability & availability**

  * **Standard / Standard-IA**: data stored redundantly across multiple AZs with 11 9’s durability.
  * **One Zone / One Zone-IA**: lower-cost single-AZ storage, still with 11 9’s AZ-level durability.
* **Broad connectivity**
  Mount via NFS v4.1/4.2 to EC2, ECS, Lambda, on-prem clients—supports thousands of concurrent connections.

### Performance Characteristics

| Mode                | Latency         | Use Case                                                                               |
| ------------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **General Purpose** | Single-digit ms | Latency-sensitive workloads (web servers, CMS) ([repost.aws][1])                       |
| **Max I/O**         | Higher (>GP)    | Massively parallel operations tolerating extra per-operation latency ([repost.aws][1]) |

| Throughput Mode        | Description                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Bursting (Elastic)** | Scales automatically with storage size and burst credits ([docs.aws.amazon.com][2])                              |
| **Provisioned**        | Specify throughput (MiB/s) independent of storage size for sustained high-throughput workloads ([repost.aws][3]) |

### Data Protection & Compliance

* **Encryption**

  * **At rest** via AWS KMS (AWS-managed or customer-managed CMKs).
  * **In transit** with TLS-encrypted NFS mounts.
* **Backups & replication**
  Integrates with AWS Backup for automated, cross-AZ and cross-region snapshots.

### Cost Considerations

* **Pay-per-use** (GiB-month stored).
* **Lifecycle policies** can auto-transition infrequently accessed files to IA tiers, saving up to \~85% for cold data.

## Amazon FSx Variants

| Variant                 | Protocols                  | Typical Use Case                                                                                                          |

| **OpenZFS**             | NFS v3–4.2 (with nconnect) | Lift-and-shift ZFS/Linux NAS; small-file workloads ([docs.aws.amazon.com][5], [aws.amazon.com][6])                        |
| **Windows File Server** | SMB 2.0–3.x                | Windows-native file shares with full NTFS & AD integration ([docs.aws.amazon.com][7], [docs.aws.amazon.com][8])           |
| **Lustre**              | Lustre                     | HPC, ML training, analytics with extreme throughput (up to >1 TB/s) ([docs.aws.amazon.com][9], [docs.aws.amazon.com][10]) |

### 1. FSx for NetApp ONTAP

* **Feature-rich**: NetApp ONTAP services (SnapMirror, FlexClone, inline compression/dedupe, tiering).
* **High performance**: SSD storage with sub-ms latencies, two-tier caching (NVMe + in-memory).
* **Availability options**: Single-AZ (lower latency) or Multi-AZ (automated failover).

### 2. FSx for OpenZFS

* **ZFS data services**: snapshots, clones, compression, replication.
* **Multi-flow throughput**: up to 16 TCP connections per mount via nconnect.
* **Storage classes**: HDD (capacity-optimized) or SSD (with in-memory hot cache).

### 3. FSx for Windows File Server

* **Native Windows features**: full NTFS semantics, shadow copies, DFS Namespaces, AD integration.
* **Performance scaling**: in-memory cache for hot data; scale throughput capacity transparently (incurs brief failover in Multi-AZ) ([docs.aws.amazon.com][11]).

### 4. FSx for Lustre

* **Extreme throughput & IOPS**: scales to >1 TB/s and millions of IOPS.
* **Seamless S3 integration**: mount S3 buckets as a POSIX file system for data lakes or HPC workflows.
* **Cache options**: in-memory server cache and optional SSD read cache for bursty workloads.

## Critical Takeaways for SAA-C03

1. **Right tool for the job**:

   * Use **EFS** for general Linux-based file sharing and web/CMS workloads.
   * Pick **FSx ONTAP/OpenZFS** for advanced data-services or lift-and-shift ZFS/NAS.
   * Choose **FSx Windows** for SMB/AD-integrated Windows applications.
   * Opt for **FSx Lustre** when you need extreme throughput for HPC, ML, or big-data analytics.
2. **Performance vs. cost trade-offs**:

   * **EFS** Max I/O and provisioned throughput boost aggregate throughput but may incur higher latencies and costs.
   * **FSx** variants offer specialized caches and high baseline performance, but licensing and HA configurations add expense.
3. **HA & durability**:

   * **EFS** and **FSx ONTAP** provide native Multi-AZ resilience.
   * **OpenZFS** relies on manual replication for multi-AZ/DR.
   * **Windows File Server** and **ONTAP** support active-passive clusters.
4. **Security & compliance**:

   * All integrate with **AWS KMS**, **VPC controls**, and major compliance programs (SOC, PCI DSS, HIPAA).

Use this matrix to justify your storage architecture decisions on the exam—linking workload requirements to service capabilities, performance characteristics, and cost profiles.

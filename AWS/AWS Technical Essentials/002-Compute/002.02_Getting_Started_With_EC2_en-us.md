# Amazon EC2 Overview

## Introduction to Amazon EC2
- **Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)** is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud.
- You can provision virtual servers called **EC2 instances**.
- **Key benefits:**
  - Launch EC2 instances quickly.
  - Secure and scalable compute power.

# Key Features of Amazon EC2
- **Provision and Launch:**
  - Launch one or more EC2 instances within minutes.
- **Stop or Shutdown:**
  - Instances can be stopped or terminated when workloads are complete.
- **Flexible Payment:**
  - Pay by the hour or second (minimum 60 seconds).
- **Management Options:**
  - Manage EC2 instances through:
    - AWS Management Console
    - AWS CLI
    - AWS SDKs
    - Automation tools
    - Infrastructure orchestration services

## Creating an EC2 Instance
To create an EC2 instance, you must define the following:

1. **Hardware Specifications:**
   - CPU
   - Memory
   - Network
   - Storage
2. **Logical Configurations:**
   - Networking location
   - Firewall rules
   - Authentication settings
   - Operating system of your choice

## Configuring EC2
- **Instance Configurations:**
  - Choose the instance type, network, and storage to create your EC2 instance.
- **Application Example:**
  - For applications like the **employee directory application**, select instances with enough capacity to process customer requests.
  - Instance sizing depends on:
    - The demands of your application
    - The anticipated size of your user base
- **Cloud Advantages vs On-Premises:**
  - **On-Premises:** Forecasting server capacity requires difficult decisions and significant upfront capital spending.
  - **Cloud-Based:** Allocation changes can be made easily with a simple **API call**.
  - AWS's **pay-as-you-go model** allows you to match infrastructure capacity to application demand, avoiding wasteful over-provisioning.

## Amazon Machine Images (AMIs)
- **Definition:**
  - When launching an EC2 instance, the first setting you configure is the operating system by selecting an **Amazon Machine Image (AMI)**.
- **Traditional vs Cloud:**
  - In traditional infrastructure, spinning up a server requires manual installation of the operating system.
  - In the AWS Cloud, operating system installation is handled via the chosen AMI.
- **AMI Components:**
  - Operating system.
  - Storage mapping.
  - Architecture type.
  - Launch permissions.
  - Preinstalled software applications.
- **Finding AMIs:**
  - There are multiple ways to select an AMI:
    1. **Quick Start AMIs**:
       - Commonly used AMIs created by AWS for quick setup.
    2. **AWS Marketplace AMIs**:
       - Popular open-source and commercial software provided by third-party vendors.
    3. **My AMIs**:
       - Custom AMIs created from your EC2 instances.
    4. **Community AMIs**:
       - AMIs provided by the AWS user community.
    5. **Custom Images**:
       - Custom-built AMIs created using the **EC2 Image Builder**.
  - **AMI IDs**:
    - Each AMI in the AWS Management Console has an **AMI ID**, prefixed by `ami-`, followed by a random hash of numbers and letters.
    - AMI IDs are unique to each AWS Region.

## Relationship between AMIs and EC2 Instances
- **Conceptual Relationship:**
  - EC2 instances are **live instantiations** of what is defined in an AMI:
    - Comparable to a cake being the live instantiation of a cake recipe.
    - In software terms, an AMI is the **class**, and an EC2 instance is the **object**.
  - When launching an instance:
    - AWS allocates a virtual machine running on a **hypervisor**.
    - The AMI is copied to the **root device volume**, providing the image used to boot the instance.
    - You can connect to the server, install packages, and deploy applications (e.g., a web server with an employee directory application).
- **Reusability of AMIs:**
  - Use a Linux-based AMI to configure an HTTP server, application packages, and additional software.
  - Create new instances with identical configurations by:
    - Manually configuring a new instance.
    - Creating an AMI from an existing instance and reusing it.
  - You can create AMIs from **running** or **stopped** instances to launch new, preconfigured instances.

## Amazon EC2 Instance Types
- EC2 instances are a combination of:
  - **vCPUs**, memory, network, instance storage, and GPUs (optional).
- **Instance Type Overview:**
  - AWS offers instances with varying performance capacities.
  - Instance types consist of:
    - **Prefix**: Type of workloads optimized for (e.g., compute).
    - **Generation**: Indicates the version (e.g., 5th generation).
    - **Additional Attributes**: Specific features (e.g., NVMe storage).
    - **Size**: Capacity (e.g., xlarge).
  - Example: `c5n.xlarge` breakdown:
    - `c`: Compute-optimized family.
    - `5`: Fifth generation.
    - `n`: Local NVMe storage attribute.
    - `xlarge`: Instance size.
- **Instance Families:**
  - Families are optimized for various workloads (e.g., graphics, general-purpose, memory-optimized).

## EC2 Instance Locations
- **Default VPC:**
  - EC2 instances launch in a default **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** unless specified.
  - Default VPC is suitable for quick setup and public EC2 instances.
  - Resources in the default VPC are **public** and accessible via the internet.
  - **Best Practice:**
    - Avoid placing sensitive data or customer information in the default VPC.
    - Use custom VPCs with restricted access for improved security and networking control.

## High Availability
- **Architecting for High Availability:**
  - Instances reside in an **Availability Zone** of your choice.
  - AWS services scoped at the Availability Zone level should be designed for high availability.
  - **Recommendations:**
    - Use multiple instances:
      - Two are better than one, and three are better than two.
      - Smaller instances can be more effective than fewer large ones.
    - Example:
      - If a single frontend instance fails, the application goes down.
      - If workloads are distributed across 10 instances and one fails, only **10% of the fleet** is affected.
  - For high availability, use at least **two EC2 instances in two separate Availability Zones**.

## AWS Well-Architected Framework and Reliability Pillar
- The **AWS Well-Architected Framework** is built on **six pillars**:
  - **Operational Excellence**, **Security**, **Reliability**, **Performance Efficiency**, **Cost Optimization**, and **Sustainability**.
- **Reliability Pillar Overview:**
  - Focuses on building architectures with:
    - Strong foundations.
    - Resilient designs.
    - Consistent change management.
    - Proven failure recovery processes.
  - Addresses challenges of traditional on-premises environments:
    - Eliminates single points of failure.
    - Provides elasticity.
    - Automates processes to respond to changing demands.
- **Failure Management:**
  - Incorporate failure recovery mechanisms and proactive monitoring solutions.
  - Use **backup and disaster recovery** strategies to ensure system reliability.

## Instance Types and Sizes
- Configure EC2 instances by **type** and **size** to match hardware requirements:
  - Types grouped based on **use cases**:
    - **Compute-optimized**, **memory-optimized**, **storage-optimized**, etc.
  - Example families:
    - **G instance family**: Optimized for **graphics-intensive applications** (e.g., 3D visualizations, video encoding).
    - **M5 General Purpose family**: Balanced resources suitable for applications like **web servers**.
  - Examples of instance types:
    - **T3.medium**, **A1.nano**, etc.
- Instances can be **resized** as needed:
  - Change types or sizes programmatically via **API** or the **AWS Management Console**.

## Flexibility and Control
- EC2 instances provide **flexibility and control** in the cloud.
- Instances can be provisioned easily, and payment is based on usage:
  - **Per second** or **per hour** depending on the instance type.
- Instances can be **terminated** or **stopped** to avoid incurring charges.
- AWS supports a range of operating systems:
  - **Linux**, **MacOS**, **Ubuntu**, **Windows**, and more.

## Business Impact
